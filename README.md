## Q&A
- Why make this app?
Christmas break had a bit of time & most online apps are unfortunately paid...

- Will you continue to improve it?
Maybe, if I get the time. There is still a huge margin for improvement and new features to be added like for example a clock and new circuits.

- Will the game be improved? 
Oh well, the project wasn't suppose to be a game - kind of forced it to be one hahaha
